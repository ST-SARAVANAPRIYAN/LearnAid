# LearnAid Refactoring Summary - Sprint 2.5 Update

## ðŸ”§ Major Refactoring Completed

### 1. **Corrected System Logic - Student-Centric Task Assignment**
**Previous Issue**: System was identifying "weak chapters" instead of "students who perform poorly on chapters"
**Fixed**: Now the system correctly identifies individual students who struggle with specific chapters and assigns them personalized tasks.

### 2. **Clear Distinction: Exams vs Frequent Assessments**

#### **Exams (Offline CIA Assessments)**
- **Purpose**: Continuous Internal Assessment (CIA1, CIA2, CIA3)
- **Format**: Offline written examinations
- **Structure**: 
  - Example: CIA exam with 12 questions (10 Ã— 2 marks + 2 Ã— 15 marks = 50 marks total)
  - Questions mapped to specific chapters (Q1-3: Chapter 1, Q4-6: Chapter 2, etc.)
- **Faculty Role**: 
  - Create exams with chapter-wise question mapping
  - Update student marks for each question
  - System calculates chapter-wise performance automatically

#### **Frequent Assessments (Task-based)**
- **Purpose**: Targeted improvement for students with poor CIA exam performance
- **Process**: System identifies students performing below threshold in specific chapters
- **Frequency**: Daily, bi-daily, or custom scheduling based on student needs
- **Content**: 
  - LLM-generated questions from uploaded PDF materials
  - Manual task creation by faculty
  - MCQ format with time limits
  - Study period + test period structure

### 3. **Updated Database Models**

#### **New Model: StudentChapterPerformance**
```python
class StudentChapterPerformance(Base):
    student_id = ForeignKey
    chapter_id = ForeignKey
    cia_exams_taken = Integer
    total_questions_attempted = Integer
    chapter_accuracy_percentage = Float
    is_weak_chapter = Boolean (True if performance < threshold)
    tasks_assigned = Integer
    tasks_completed = Integer
    improvement_trend = String
    last_cia_exam_date = DateTime
    next_task_due_date = DateTime
```

#### **Enhanced Task Model**
```python
class Task(Base):
    # New fields for frequent assessments
    target_performance_threshold = Float
    target_student_count = Integer
    study_material = Text
    study_time_minutes = Integer
    llm_generation_prompt = Text
    source_pdf_content = Text
    auto_assign_to_poor_performers = Boolean
```

#### **Enhanced TaskAssignment Model**
```python
class TaskAssignment(Base):
    # New fields for detailed tracking
    assignment_reason = String  # "Poor CIA1 performance in Chapter 3 (35%)"
    triggering_exam_id = ForeignKey
    student_chapter_performance = Float
    target_improvement_percentage = Float
    is_auto_assigned = Boolean
    auto_assignment_algorithm = String
```

### 4. **New API Endpoints**

#### **Performance Analytics API** (`/api/v1/performance/`)
- `GET /students/{student_id}/chapter-performance` - Get student's chapter-wise performance
- `GET /courses/{course_id}/weak-students` - Identify students needing help
- `POST /students/{student_id}/assign-task` - Manual task assignment
- `POST /auto-assign-tasks` - Automated task assignment to weak students

### 5. **Responsive Frontend Redesign**

#### **Enhanced Layout Component**
- **Mobile-First Design**: Responsive navigation with collapsible sidebar
- **Professional UI**: Modern card-based design with better spacing
- **Improved Navigation**: Clean menu items with proper active states
- **Better Typography**: Hierarchical text styles and readable fonts

#### **New Pages Added**
- **ðŸ“Š Performance Analytics**: 
  - Visual dashboard showing students needing help
  - Chapter-wise performance breakdown
  - Auto-assignment capabilities
  - Responsive data tables with filters

- **ðŸ“‹ Tasks Management**:
  - Task creation and management interface
  - Support for both manual and AI-generated tasks
  - Task assignment tracking
  - Responsive design with proper mobile layout

### 6. **Key Features Implemented**

#### **Student Performance Tracking**
- Automatic calculation of chapter-wise performance from CIA exam results
- Identification of students performing below configurable thresholds
- Historical performance tracking and trend analysis

#### **Intelligent Task Assignment**
- Auto-assignment of tasks to students with poor chapter performance
- Customizable performance thresholds (30%, 40%, 50%, 60%)
- Task scheduling based on individual student needs
- Support for daily, bi-daily, and custom frequencies

#### **Faculty Dashboard Enhancements**
- Modern, responsive interface that works on all devices
- Professional sidebar navigation with clean icons
- Improved data visualization with charts and progress indicators
- Better user experience with consistent Material UI components

### 7. **Technical Improvements**

#### **Database Schema Updates**
- Proper foreign key relationships for performance tracking
- Efficient indexing for quick student performance queries
- Separation of exam data from task data for better organization

#### **API Architecture**
- RESTful endpoints following best practices
- Proper error handling and validation
- Background task support for auto-assignments
- Comprehensive logging for debugging

#### **Frontend Architecture**
- Removal of static layouts in favor of responsive design
- Material UI Grid v7 compatibility fixes
- Proper component organization and reusability
- Clean separation of concerns

## ðŸŽ¯ System Workflow

### 1. **CIA Exam Management**
1. Faculty creates CIA exam with chapter-wise question mapping
2. Students take offline written exam
3. Faculty updates marks for each question
4. System calculates student performance by chapter

### 2. **Automated Task Assignment**
1. System analyzes CIA exam results
2. Identifies students below performance threshold for each chapter
3. Auto-assigns appropriate frequent assessment tasks
4. Students receive notifications for assigned tasks

### 3. **Student Improvement Cycle**
1. Student studies provided material for allocated time
2. Takes timed assessment on weak chapter topics
3. System tracks completion and performance
4. Faculty monitors progress and improvement trends

## ðŸš€ Ready for Sprint 3
