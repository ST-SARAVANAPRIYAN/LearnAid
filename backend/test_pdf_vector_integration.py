    This is a comprehensive test of PDF processing with vector database integration. 
    The system is designed to handle PDF uploads by splitting the content into chunks 
    of exactly 500 characters with an overlap of 100 characters between consecutive chunks.
    
    This approach ensures that information spanning chunk boundaries is not lost and 
    provides better context for semantic search and retrieval operations. The vector 
    database stores embeddings of each chunk, allowing for efficient similarity search 
    and content discovery within the educational platform.
    
    Each chunk maintains metadata about its source document, course association, 
    chapter information, and position within the original document. This metadata 
    enables precise tracking and organization of content across different courses 
    and educational materials.

    Chapter 1: Introduction to Machine Learning
    
    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on the development 
    of algorithms and statistical models that enable computer systems to automatically 
    improve their performance on a specific task through experience.
    
    The core principle behind machine learning is to create systems that can learn and 
    adapt without being explicitly programmed for every possible scenario. This is 
    achieved through the analysis of data patterns and the creation of mathematical 
    models that can make predictions or decisions.
    
    There are three main types of machine learning: supervised learning, unsupervised 
    learning, and reinforcement learning. Each type has its own characteristics and 
    applications in solving different types of problems.
    
    Supervised learning involves training algorithms on labeled datasets, where the 
    correct answers are provided. The algorithm learns to map inputs to outputs based 
    on this training data and can then make predictions on new, unseen data.
